👋 **Hey!** Looks like you stumbled upon my profile, or maybe you’re here to know more about me. Either way, welcome!

I’m **Ahmad**, a full-stack developer who’s passionate about crafting seamless web experiences. Here’s a bit about what I do:

💻 **Backend**: I thrive on creating fast, scalable APIs that power efficient web applications. Whether it’s Node, Express, PHP, or Laravel, I love building the backbone of great web systems.

🎨 **Frontend**: On the flip side, I’m all about bringing stunning UI to life with JavaScript, Typescript, Nextjs, React, Vue.js, HTML, and CSS. Responsive layouts, intuitive designs, and delightful animations? That’s my playground.

🎯 **Focus**: I’ve got an eye for detail, so I aim to make every interaction smooth and user-friendly, ensuring everything looks and works beautifully across all devices.

🌱 **Currently Learning**: I’m sharpening my skills in the integration of AI models into web applications and exploring even more ways to build better, faster web experiences.

⚡️ If you're looking to collaborate or just chat, feel free to reach out!
